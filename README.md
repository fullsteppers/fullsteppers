## Usage

Using Fullsteppers is fairly straightforward.

To practice dancing with one of the app's pre-loaded routines, select "Choose Dance" on the home screen.

From there, you will be prompted to choose a song to dance to, a dance speed, and a stance width. Then, get practicing!

To create your own dance for custom practice, select "Create Dance" on the home screen.

Use the arrow menu to direct footsteps. After each arrow push, save that move by hitting "Save." If you regret saving a move, you can undo your last save by hitting "Undo."

Choose which foot to move by toggling the "Right" to "Left" and back again.

To test your new dance sequence, hit the "Test" button.

Finally, to save, hit "Create." In the next screen, you can select a dance name and a gif that suits its personality.

Now, to practice your customized dance routine for real, just select it from "Choose Dance."
